.. rubric:: Everything you need to know about restkit

**kit* is an **HTTP resource kit for Python**, inspired by the
microframework (Camping, Sinatra) style of specifying actions: get, head, put, post, delete. 

Made by `Enki Multimedia <http://www.e-engura.org>`_ for one of our project and we decided to make it public.
