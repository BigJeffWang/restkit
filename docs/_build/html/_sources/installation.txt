Installation
============

The most recent release is always available in the `cheeseshop`_ and can be
installed using `easy_install`_::

    easy_install -U restkit

Alternatively, you can also install the development version from 
our `Mercurial`_ repository::

    hg clone https://benoitc@bitbucket.org/benoitc/restkit/
    cd restkit
    sudo python setup.py install

The last command will install restkit as a package via setuptools. This
will make it available in your python path. Alternatively you can copy or symlink
the restkit subdirectory into your site-packages directory or
anywhere in your PYTHONPATH.

Requirements
============

To use testkit you will need **Python 2.5**, **Python 2.6x* recommended
